üö® **SECURITY NOTICE** üö®

## API Credentials Security

**IMPORTANT**: Your Binance API credentials were found in configuration files. This is a serious security risk!

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Regenerate your API keys** in your Binance account immediately:
   - Go to Binance ‚Üí Account ‚Üí API Management
   - Delete the current API key
   - Create new API credentials

2. **Check all other systems** where you might have used these credentials:
   - Other trading bots
   - Configuration files
   - Scripts or notebooks

### Secure Storage Best Practices:

1. **Use Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   export BINANCE_API_KEY="your_new_api_key"
   export BINANCE_SECRET_KEY="your_new_secret_key"
   ```

2. **Use .env file** (not committed to git):
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your real credentials
   ```

3. **Never commit credentials** to version control:
   - Always use placeholder values in example files
   - Use .gitignore to exclude sensitive files
   - Use environment variables in production

### GitHub Repository Security:

Before uploading to GitHub:
1. ‚úÖ All files now use placeholder credentials
2. ‚úÖ .gitignore is configured properly
3. ‚úÖ .env.template provides secure guidance
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è  **You still need to regenerate your API keys**

### What Was Fixed:

- `/root/binance-mcp-server/USAGE.md` - Replaced real credentials with placeholders
- All example configurations now use safe placeholder values
- Other files already had secure placeholder values

### Repository Status:

‚úÖ **Safe to upload to GitHub** - No real credentials remain in the codebase
‚ö†Ô∏è  **Action Required** - Regenerate your Binance API keys immediately
